Generate graphs with python networkx and display them with cytoscape.js.

Page reload generates a new graph.


Here's also some useful Glitch starter info modified using
https://support.glitch.com/t/how-to-use-python-on-glitch/11201/9:

- having a requirements.txt file puts Glitch into Python mode,
  installing from requirements.txt and starting from start.sh
  
- having a glitch.json file puts Glitch into custom mode,
  installing and running whatever you've defined
  (see e.g. flask-python3)
  
- having a package.json file (Node backend) is the common way
  (see also https://glitch.com/help/restrictions/)
  
- (having no backend is a way too, as in hello-basic).
